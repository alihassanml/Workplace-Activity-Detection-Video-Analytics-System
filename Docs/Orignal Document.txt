# Visual Analytics Scope

## **Project Scope: Custom Workplace Activity Detection with Open-Source AI**

## **Objective**

Develop an AI-powered video analytics system that detects specific employee activities in workplace footage:

- Mobile phone usage
- People sleeping
- Clock in/out events
- Eating at workstations
- Smoke breaks (outdoor/indoor)

---

## **Key Deliverables**

1. **Custom Object/Activity Detection Models**
    - Train and deploy AI models (YOLO, OpenCV, Detectron2, or MediaPipe) for the above activities.
    - Models should work on typical office surveillance footage.
2. **Data Handling**
    - Assist with collection, cleaning, and labeling of sample data (images/videos) representing each activity.
    - Provide guidance on how much data is needed for each detection category.
3. **System Integration**
    - Build backend pipeline to process live or recorded video streams.
    - Integrate with standard IP cameras or local video files.
4. **User Interface (Optional)**
    - Simple dashboard to view detections, review flagged events, and configure detection alerts.
5. **Reporting & Notifications**
    - Capability to export logs or reports of detected activities.
    - Optional real-time or periodic notification system for policy violations.
6. **Deployment & Documentation**
    - Deploy system on provided server (cloud or on-premise).
    - Provide usage documentation and installation guide.

## **Requirements**

## **Technical**

- Use modern open-source computer vision frameworks (e.g., YOLOv8+, OpenCV, Detectron2, or MediaPipe).
- Python stack preferred, with containerization (Docker) for easy deployment.
- Clear code structure and documentation for future maintenance.

## **Integration**

- Connects to existing office cameras or can ingest local video files.
- Results available via simple web app/dashboard or exportable logs.
